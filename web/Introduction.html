<span class="anchor" id="line-2"></span><p class="line874">We definitely live in an IP world, and IPv4 is still alive. More and more devices are connected to the Internet or to ISP private infrastructure. Each device needs to be delivered an IP address before being usable, stressing more and more demanding needs on DHCP infrastructure. <span class="anchor" id="line-3"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-4"></span><p class="line874">DHCP was originally designed for Local Area Networks (LAN) to manage tens or hundreds of computers and IP addresses. It is now common for an ISP to manage millions or tens of millions of customers on central infrastructures. DHCP needs to follow this trend and to be able to bring carrier-grade solutions to IP addresses distribution. <span class="anchor" id="line-5"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-6"></span><p class="line874">This is were DHCP Cluster was born. Its goals are to provide (in this order of priority): <span class="anchor" id="line-7"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-8"></span><ul><li><p class="line891"><strong>Reliability </strong>(mainly through high availability) <span class="anchor" id="line-9"></span></li><li><p class="line891"><strong>Extendability </strong>(being able to adapt to specific contexts) <span class="anchor" id="line-10"></span></li><li><p class="line891"><strong>Performance </strong>(and Scalability obviously) <span class="anchor" id="line-11"></span></li><li><p class="line891"><strong>Simplicity </strong> <span class="anchor" id="line-12"></span></li></ul><p class="line874">Note: DHCP Cluster is targeted to small networks LAN DHCP Server as well as large scale ISP solutions. <span class="anchor" id="line-13"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-14"></span><p class="line874">It is available in two flavours: <span class="anchor" id="line-15"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-16"></span><ul><li><p class="line891"><strong>Basic</strong>: all in one solution, very simple to install and manage, powerful, single-server <span class="anchor" id="line-17"></span></li><li><p class="line891"><strong>Extended</strong>: (coming soon) multi-server with high availability database, very high performance, large network topologies <span class="anchor" id="line-18"></span></li></ul><p class="line867">
<h1 id="head-95e6c57af9b57a0a333a06c91f7935c79c35a882">History (2004-2007)</h1>
<span class="anchor" id="line-19"></span><p class="line874">In 2004, we were looking for a robust high performance DHCP server suitable for an France Telecom ADSL IPTV solution. The prototype already developped was based on ISC dhcpd but proved to be very hard to maintain and to plug to an existing Oracle database. <span class="anchor" id="line-20"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-21"></span><p class="line874">At that time, the DHCP algorithm was very simple. Each client had a fixed address depending on its position in the DSLAM marked via option-82. This simple algorithm would calculate the client address then update the Oracle database to mark the client as connected. ISC dhpcd was absolutely not suited for such an "algorithmic" address alocation. <span class="anchor" id="line-22"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-23"></span><p class="line874">I have already believed that DHCP was a simple protocol and that developing a industrial-strength server solution was not so difficult. My thoughts were quickly confirmed. <span class="anchor" id="line-24"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-25"></span><p class="line862">IAnd yet, we did not find any suitable solutions at that time. So I decided to develop a simple prototype in Perl to check the faisability. A few weeks later it was ready and gave excellent results. At the same time, I revived the Perl module <a class="http" href="http://search.cpan.org/~shadinger/Net-DHCP/">Net::DHCP</a> to offer a full DHCP API. <span class="anchor" id="line-26"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-27"></span><p class="line874">The full server was then industrialized by a small project team and eventually put into production by end 2004. Performance was still quite high despite the interprative nature of Perl, resulting in more than 600rq/s on a standard Xeon 3.2GHz server. <span class="anchor" id="line-28"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-29"></span><p class="line874">Note: the module Net::DHCP is not very active anymore but I still do some bug correction from time to time. The active version is the Java one - dhcp4java. <span class="anchor" id="line-30"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-31"></span><p class="line862">The IPTV service evolved to a more classical dynamic addresses allocation mecanism. We had lots of discussion about what would be the best software architecture with internal R&amp;D people, and this is where the DHCP Cluster architecture came into life. It is basically a transposition of the classical Web architecture - J2EE frontend / Database persistant store. <span class="anchor" id="line-32"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-33"></span><p class="line874">We plugged the Perl server to an Oracle database. It shortly became obvious that we had to share our developments to a broader community in the company, and Perl was not the most easily readable and sharable code. We decided to switch to Java. The good news at that time was that the Java version was nearly 10x faster than the Perl version (which was already not so bad). <span class="anchor" id="line-34"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-35"></span><p class="line862">This is were<strong> dhcp4java </strong>began, first as a Java port of Net::DHCP, then as a richer and more complet DHCP Api. <span class="anchor" id="line-36"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-37"></span><p class="line874">At that point we decided to share our DHCP Cluster developments with the open-source community to deploy more widely this solution and benefit from your enhancements. <span class="anchor" id="line-38"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-39"></span><p class="line867">
